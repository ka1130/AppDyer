# AppDyer

A simple app that lets user pick up the background color based on autosuggestion.
Start typing and from the second letter on, autosuggestion is truggered.
User submits the choice by clicking the `Accept` button, turning the background into 50% opacity selected color.

Due to lack of support for native HTML5 `<datalist>`, the autosuggestion is implemented from scratch and works cross-browser.
